Pre-commit hook to check formatting

Install by copying the `pre-commit` file into your project's `.git/hooks` folder. Or you can choose to symlink if you want to manage only one file across multilpe projects.
If you're using multiple versions of `mix` or want to specify a specific version, modify the file and point it to `mix`'s location.
